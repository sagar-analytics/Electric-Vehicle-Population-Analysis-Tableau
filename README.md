# 🚗⚡ **Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)**

This project presents an interactive Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis Dashboard built using Tableau.
It provides insights into the adoption, distribution, and characteristics of electric vehicles across the U.S., using a dataset of 150K+ EV records.

The dashboard enables filtering by CAFV Eligibility, EV Type, Model, and State, giving users the flexibility to analyze the data from multiple perspectives.

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This Tableau project aims to analyze and visualize key EV trends, including:

* Total Electric Vehicles

* Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)

* Average Electric Range

* EV distribution across states

* Year-wise EV growth

* Top vehicle makes and models

* CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility analysis

The dashboard is designed for quick exploration and clear insights into the growing EV market in the U.S.
